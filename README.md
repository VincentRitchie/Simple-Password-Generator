## Summary
A Python-based password generator that creates a random password with user-specified numbers of letters, digits, and symbols.

## Description
This project is a simple and interactive password generator script written in Python. The user is prompted to input the number of letters, numerical digits, and symbols they want in their password. The script then generates a password with the specified criteria, shuffles the characters for randomness, and displays the generated password.

## Features
- **User Input:** User input for the number of letters, digits, and symbols.
- **Random Selection:** Random selection of characters from predefined lists.
- **Shuffling:** Shuffling to ensure the randomness of the password.
- **Ease of Use:** Easy to run and understand.

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter the desired number of letters, digits, and symbols.
3. Get your randomly generated password.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Password Strength Indicator**

    Add a feature to indicate the strength of the generated password, providing feedback on how to create stronger passwords.

2. **Save to File**

    Implement a functionality to save the generated password to a file for later use.

3. **GUI Version**

    Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the password generator more user-friendly.
